### Kia ora! I'm Cypress 🤙🏽


## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Junior Full-Stack Web Developer** based in New Plymouth, New Zealand, passionate about solving problems through code. I recently completed an intensive bootcamp at **Dev Academy Aotearoa**, where I built full-stack applications and developed strong technical and collaborative skills.

I love breaking down complex challenges and creating solutions that actually work. Currently seeking my first role in web development where I can contribute, learn, and grow alongside experienced developers.
