### Kia ora! I'm Cypress 🤙🏽


## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Junior Full-Stack Web Developer** based in New Plymouth, New Zealand, very ready to enter the tech world!. I recently completed a 10 month bootcamp at **Dev Academy Aotearoa**, where I built full-stack applications and developed strong technical and collaborative skills.

I really enjoy figuring out how to solve problems in the most efficent way i can find. Currently seeking my first role in web development where I can contribute, learn, and grow alongside experienced developers.
